# HackSprint
Develop a peer networking platform primarily focused on connecting new students with their seniors. The platform will provide detailed information about each senior, including the courses they have completed in previous terms. This will enable new students to seek guidance and mentorship from seniors with relevant experience.

Additionally, the platform will prioritize the mental health of students pursuing this standalone degree, offering resources and support to ensure their well-being throughout their academic journey.
